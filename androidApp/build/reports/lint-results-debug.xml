        message="Library lint checks reference invalid APIs; these checks **will be skipped**!&#xA;&#xA;Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.compose.runtime.lint.RuntimeIssueRegistry`)&#xA;which contains some references to invalid API:&#xA;org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.session.KtAnalysisSessionProvider: org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.lifetime.KtLifetimeTokenFactory getTokenFactory()&#xA;(Referenced from androidx/compose/runtime/lint/AutoboxingStateCreationDetector.class)&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, this lint check library is **not** included&#xA;in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:&#xA;`AutoboxingStateValueProperty`&#xA;`AutoboxingStateCreation`&#xA;`CoroutineCreationDuringComposition`&#xA;`FlowOperatorInvokedInComposition`&#xA;`ComposableLambdaParameterNaming`&#xA;`ComposableLambdaParameterPosition`&#xA;`ComposableNaming`&#xA;`StateFlowValueCalledInComposition`&#xA;`CompositionLocalNaming`&#xA;`MutableCollectionMutableState`&#xA;`ProduceStateDoesNotAssignValue`&#xA;`RememberReturnType`&#xA;`OpaqueUnitKey`&#xA;`UnrememberedMutableState`&#xA;&#xA;To use this lint check, upgrade to a more recent version&#xA;of the library."

        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">
